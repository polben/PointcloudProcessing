The application uses many libraries so I only provide the base code for the implementation.
Using an IDE you can import the libraries one by one, or run pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.
Run the main.py file to start the application. 

For running (and importing the libs) I recommend Pycharm Community edition available for free at https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
